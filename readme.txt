Collaborated with Angelica on ideas for implementing the fileCreator method for the game.

I know this isn't finished. I've had a hectic past few days, between my job back home over the weekend, shooting
my final film project in two days, and getting sick. I decided that I'd rather submit it in this state and give
myself time to rest so I can be at my best for the next and final assignment. Also, I'm out of extension days to
use without losing the bonus of getting my lowest homework grade removed from my grade at the end of the semester.
Which, if I can add, I find to be an unproductive extension system as it discourages me from using them even when
I would absoltuely need the extra time to complete the requirements of the assignment completely. I don't like
turning in unfinished work, especially work that I know I could understand better with more time. In this case,
it was a mix of responsibilities outside this class and unforeseen problems popping up that kept me from
completing it.

I understand that you wanted me to work alone as a test of sorts to see if Musa or I were depending on each
other. My inability to complete the assignment was related to a lack of time to fully grasp the instructions
and come up with ways to implement the aspects of the game, not that we worked individually. I'd like
to emphasize that I am very capable of grasping ideas and programming independently, and would appreciate it if
you could take both Musa and I's words on that. I still collaborated with others in TA hours as both of us
usually do and found both myself and my peers still struggling at many points. I will likely continue to work
with Musa for brainstorming and pair programming as I feel we both highlight and improve each others' abilities
rather than lean on them. If you'd like to discuss this further, please feel free to reach out to me via Slack,
email, or whatever is easiest for you. Thank you.
